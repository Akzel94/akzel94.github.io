      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <div id="what-is-akzeltech">
        <p>I've been a passionate Linux user for over three years now; I've been a content creator (i.e. YouTuber) for more than twelve. In those three years of using Linux, my video content become a lot more focused on Linuxy things, as well as FOSS and tech in general. I wanted to create a central "brand" that all of my Linux, FOSS, and tech content could live under, so I went with "AkzelTech."</p>

        <p>The goal for this website is to provide a hub for all of the content that I produce, as well as written and/or video guides to help newcomers to Linux. At the moment, however, it's very much a work-in-progress. You can follow the progress over on the <a href="https://github.com/Akzel94/akzel94.github.io" target="_blank">GitHub page</a>.</p>

        <p>Head over to the <a href="contact.html">Contact</a> page if you want to get in touch directly.</p>
